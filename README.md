# Lifx Python Library

## Plan
- Going to use `requests` library


To do:
- [x] Decide on libraries / frameworks 
- [x] Sketch out architecture / design
- [ ] Figure out how to do auth (how to configure and store etc)
- [ ] Set up linting, typechecking, formatting, dev scripts
- [ ] Can use [this](https://pypi.org/project/responses/) for testing
